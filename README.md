## About Me  
Iâ€™m a clinicianâ€“data scientist with a multidisciplinary background spanning medicine, nursing, and defense analytics.
I co-authored the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command AI Implementation Strategy, contributing to the development of predictive models and decision-support tools for biomedical and operational missions.
Iâ€™m currently focused on applying reproducible data science to surgical and neurosurgical outcomes research and am exploring collaboration opportunities with faculty at the University of New Mexico.
